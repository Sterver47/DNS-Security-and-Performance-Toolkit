# DNS-Security-and-Performance-Toolkit
## Overview
This toolkit is designed for evaluating DNS servers, with a focus on testing their security features and performance. Specifically, it allows you to assess whether DNS servers effectively block malicious domains by checking against a file defined by the user. This file is intended to contain domains from blocklists that can be downloaded from the internet.

Additionally, the toolkit measures both ping and DNS query latency over time, enabling you to analyze and compare the performance of different DNS servers.

## Functionality
- Security Evaluation: Test DNS servers to determine if they block domains listed in a user-defined file, which is typically populated with domains from downloaded blocklists.
- Performance Monitoring: Measure and record the latency of DNS queries and pings over extended periods. This data can then be analyzed to compare the efficiency and reliability of various DNS servers.
- Comprehensive Analysis: The toolkit includes scripts to analyze the collected latency data, providing insights into the relative performance of different DNS servers.
